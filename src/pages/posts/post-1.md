## What I've accomplished

**Context**: I've enrolled in a Computer Science university program! Time to finally and fully immerse in the tech world. A few days before the semester started, I realized I needed a schedule that I could quickly and easily access. That's when I decided to explore the feasibility of building one with ChatGPT. The answer turned out to be: quite feasible!

**Goal(s)**: The application's core idea was simple - to create, view, update, and delete class schedule entries using Python. The learning curve here involved understanding SQL queries and how Python interacts with databases.

**Modifications:** For adding some pizzazz to the app, I stumbled upon Python's Rich library. It was perfect for jazzing up the class schedule display with a splash of color and style in the table format. Additionally, I created a Linux alias for quick access to the application directly from the terminal.

## What's next

**Exploring CSV Integration**: The next objective for the project is to enable Python to read data from a CSV file and output the results. This approach is particularly appealing due to the portability and ease of editing that CSV files offer. As I progress in my degree, I plan to introduce options for different semesters in the app, allowing me to select the specific semester's schedule I wish to view. Once a semester is over, its schedule becomes less relevant, but keeping it accessible serves as a valuable learning opportunity. Understanding how to manage these distinct categories in a CLI app will lay the groundwork for future tools I might develop.
